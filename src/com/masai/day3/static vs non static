Ques :- What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables 
of a class explain it with an example?

Ans :- 
There are three types of variables in Java:
*Local Variables
*Instance Variables
*Static Variables

The Local variables and Instance variables are together called Non-Static variables.
Hence it can also be said that the Java variables can be divided into 2 categories
static and non static variables:


The main differences between static and non static variables are:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ STATIC VARIABLES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
Static variables can be accessed using class name	
Static variables can be accessed by static and non static methods	
Static variables reduce the amount of memory used by a program.	
Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.	
Static variable is like a global variable and is available to all methods.	

WHERE AS :-

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NON STATIC VARIABLES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Non static variables can be accessed using instance of a class
Non static variables cannot be accessed inside a static method.
Non static variables do not reduce the amount of memory used by a program
Non static variables are specific to that instance of a class.
Non static variable is like a local variable and they can be accessed through only instance of a class.

EXAMPLE :-

// Java program to demonstrate execution
// of static blocks and variables

class Test {
    // static variable
    static int a = m1();
  
    // static block
    static
    {
        System.out.println("Inside static block");
    }
  
    // static method
    static int m1()
    {
        System.out.println("from m1");
        return 20;
    }
  
    // static method(main !!)
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Value of a : " + a);
        System.out.println("from main");
    }
}

OUTPUT -: 
from m1
Inside static block
Value of a : 20
from main


==========================================================================


// Java program to demonstrate
// non-static variables
  
class Vmr {
  
    // non-static variable
    int rj = 10;
  
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Instance created inorder to access
        // a non static variable.
        Vmr f = new Vmr();
  
        System.out.println("Non static variable"
                           + " accessed using instance"
                           + " of a class");
        System.out.println("Non Static variable "
                           + f.rj);
    }
}

OUTPUT -: 
Non static variable accessed using instance of a class.
Non Static variable 10
