It is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than
compile-time.

In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a
superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being
referred to by the reference variable.

eg.

Class A
{
	void print()
	{
		System.out.println("Class A");
	}
}

Class B extends A
{
	void print()
	{
		System.out.println("Class B");
	}
}

Class main
{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		B b = new B();
		b.print();	//class B print method will run because print method is overridden.
		A a = new B();
		a.print(); //class B print method will run because print method is overridden.
	}
}
